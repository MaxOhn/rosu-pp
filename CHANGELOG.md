## Upcoming

  - __Additions:__
    - Added `From<u8>` impl for `GameMode`
    - Added the method `AnyPP::hitresult_priority`
  
- __Breaking adjustments:__
  - Removed the method `HitObject::end_time` from the public api.
  - Overhauled gradual calculation. All relevant types are now gated behind the `gradual` feature which must be enabled.
  - `*GradualDifficultyAttributes` has been renamed to `*GradualDifficulty` and `*GradualPerformanceAttributes`
    has been renamed to `*GradualPerformance`.
  - Types for gradual calculation that depend on a lifetime now have a counterpart without a lifetime that might clone
    underlying data along the way. E.g. now there is `CatchOwnedGradualDifficulty` and `[Mode]OwnedGradualPerformance`.
  - `OsuGradualDifficulty` and thus `GradualDifficulty` no longer implement `Clone`.
  - Gradual performance calculators' method `process_next_object` has been renamed to `next` and `process_next_n_objects`
    has been renamed to `nth`. They now also have the new method `last`.
  - Similar to `Iterator::nth`, gradual performance calculators' method `nth` is now zero-indexed i.e. passing `n=0`
    will process 1 object, `n=1` will process 2, and so on.

# v0.9.5 (2023-09-06)

- __Additions:__
  - Added the method `{AnyStars/AnyPP}::is_convert` which **needs** to be used if the map was manually converted beforehand

- __Adjustments:__
  - Specified clock rates can go below 0.001 again

- __Fixes:__
  - Fixed underflow for osu!std scores that were FCs but quit mid-slider
  - Fixed panic on incorrect file headers ([#21])

## v0.9.4 (2023-02-09)

- __Additions:__
  - Added the method `{TaikoPP/ManiaPP}::is_convert` which **needs** to be used if the map was manually converted beforehand

- __Adjustments:__
  - Specified clock rates can no longer go below 0.001 to prevent crashing due to memory hogging.
  - (technically breaking) The only reasons for parsing to fail are now IO errors or invalid file headers. All other `ParseError` variants have been removed and instead of throwing an error the line is just ignored.

- __Fixes:__
  - The `Beatmap::bpm` method now works properly by considering the most common beat length instead of just the first one

## v0.9.3 (2023-01-28)

- __Additions:__
  - Added the method `ScoreState::total_hits`
  - Added the trait methods `BeatmapExt::{mode}_hitobjects` which return a list of mode-specific processed `HitObject`s ([#20])

- __Fixes:__
  - Lines with invalid curve points are now ignored instead of throwing an error while parsing
  - Fixed a niche capacity overflow in curve generation

## v0.9.2 (2022-11-08)

- __Adjustments:__
  - When passing an osu!std map to `TaikoGradualDifficultyAttributes` or `ManiaGradualDifficultyAttributes`, it now automatically converts the map internally. For osu!catch it was already happening trivially.

- __Fixes:__
  - Fixed passed object count for taiko by ignoring non-circles
  - Fixed a niche panic on UTF-16 encoded maps ([#18])
  - Fixed an occasional underflow when calculating accuracy pp
  - Fixed an infinite loop on special ctb maps

## v0.9.1 (2022-10-26)

- __Adjustments:__
  - When passing an osu!std map to `TaikoPP` or `ManiaPP`, it now automatically converts the map internally. For osu!catch it was already happening trivially.

- __Fixes:__
  - The fields `section_len` for all strain structs no longer depends on the clock rate.

## v0.9.0 (2022-10-24)

## v0.5.0 (2022-03-21)

- __Fixes:__
  - Fixed panic on maps with 0 objects
  - Fixed droplet timings on juicestreams with span count >1
  - Fixed timing point parsing on some (older) maps where "uninherited" value did not coincide with beat length
  - Fixed handling .osu files with missing difficulty attributes
  - Fixed huge memory allocations caused by incorrectly parsing .osu files
- __Breaking changes:__
  - The `stars` and `strains` functions for all modes were removed. Instead use the `{Mode}Stars` builder pattern which is similar to `{Mode}PP`.
  - `BeatmapExt::stars`'s definition was adjusted to use the `AnyStars` builder struct
  - Store `HitObject::sound` in `Beatmap::sounds` instead to reduce the struct size
  - Removed the mode features `osu`, `fruits`, `taiko`, and `mania`. Now all modes are always supported.
  - Renamed the `rosu_pp::fruits` module to `rosu_pp::catch`. Similarly, all structs `Fruits{Name}` were renamed to `Catch{Name}` and enums over the mode have their `Fruits` variant renamed to `Catch`
  - Renamed `Mods`' method `speed` to `clock_rate`
- __Additions:__
  - Added `AttributeProvider` impl for `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes`
  - Added the method `clock_rate` to `{Mode}PP` and `{Mode}Stars` to consider a custom clock rate instead of the one dictated by mods.

## v0.4.0 (2021-11-25)

- Fixed out of bounds panic on maps with single-control-point linear sliders
- Fixed incorrect attributes on maps with only 1 or 2 hit objects for all modes
- Added method `Beatmap::from_path` so the file does not have to be created manually for `Beatmap::parse`.
- Added a bunch of documentation.
- Added method `Beatmap::bpm`
- Added method `max_combo` for `DifficultyAttributes`, `PerformanceAttributes`, and all `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes`
- Added methods `TaikoDifficultyAttributes::max_combo` and `OsuDifficultyAttributes::max_combo`
- Added structs `{Mode}GradualDifficultyAttributes` to calculate a map's difficulty after every or every few objects instead of calling the mode's `stars` function over and over.
- Added structs `{Mode}GradualPerformanceAttributes` to calculate the performance on a map after every or every few objects instead of using `{Mode}PP` over and over.
- Added `BeatmapExt::gradual_difficulty` and `BeatmapExt::gradual_performance` to gradually calculate the difficulty or performance on maps of any mode, hit object by hit object.
- Added methods `{Mode}PP::state` that take a `{Mode}ScoreState` (same for `AnyPP` and `ScoreState`) to set all parameters at once.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `ParseError` variants `InvalidPathType` and `InvalidTimingSignature` and renamed `InvalidFloatingPoint` to `InvalidDecimalNumber`.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `last_control_point` field of `HitObjectKind::Slider` when neither the `osu` nor the `fruits` feature is enabled.
- [BREAKING] Added the field `TaikoDifficultyAttributes::max_combo`
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `attributes` field to `difficulty` for all `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes` structs
- [BREAKING] Replaced field `FruitsDifficultyAttributes::max_combo` by a method with the same name

## v0.3.0 (2021-11-14)

- [BREAKING] With the importance of sliders for osu!standard, the `no_sliders_no_leniency` feature became too inaccurate. Additionally, since considering sliders now inherently drags performance down a little more, the difference between `no_leniency` and `all_included` became too small. Hence, the three osu features `no_sliders_no_leniency`, `no_leniency`, and `all_included` were removed. When the `osu` feature is enabled, it will now essentially use `all_included` under the hood.
  Additionally, instead of importing through `rosu_pp::osu::{version}`, you now have to import through `rosu_pp::osu`.
- [BREAKING] Instead of returning `PpResult`, performance calculations now return `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes` and `PpResult` has been renamed to `PerformanceAttributes`.
- [BREAKING] Instead of returning `StarResult`, difficulty calculations now return `{Mode}DifficultyAttributes` and `StarResult` has been renamed to `DifficultyAttributes`.
- [BREAKING] Various fields and methods now include `f64` instead of `f32` to stay true to osu!'s original code
- Added internal binary crate `pp-gen` to calculate difficulty & pp values via `PerformanceCalculator.dll`
- Added internal binary crate `pp-plot` to plot out differences between `pp-gen`'s output and `rosu-pp` values
- osu: Updated up to commit [9fb2402781ad91c197d51aeec716b0000f52c4d1](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commit/9fb2402781ad91c197d51aeec716b0000f52c4d1) (2021-11-12)
