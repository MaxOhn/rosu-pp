## Upcoming

- __Additions__:
  - Added the `ControlPoint` and `ControlPointerIter` types to the public interface, aswell as the `Beatmap::control_points` method
  - `TimingPoint` and `DifficultyPoint` now implement `Default`
  - Added new methods to `Beatmap`:
    - `convert_mode`: Convert a map into another mode. (doesn't do anything if the starting map is not osu!standard)
    - `total_break_time`: Return the accumulated break time in milliseconds
    - `timing_point_at`: Return the timing point for the given timestamp
    - `difficulty_point_at`: Return the difficulty point for the given timestamp if available
- __Breaking changes:__
  - Moved some types to a different module. The following types can now be found in `rosu_pp::beatmap`:
    - `Beatmap`
    - `BeatmapAttributes`
    - `ControlPoint`
    - `ControlPointIter`
    - `DifficultyPoint`
    - `GameMode`
    - `TimingPoint`
  - Added a new field `kiai: bool` to both `TimingPoint` and `DifficultyPoint` to denote whether the current timing section is in kiai mode
  - Added a new field `breaks: Vec<Break>` to `Beatmap` that contains all breaks throughout the map
  - Added a new field `edge_sounds: Vec<u8>` to the `Slider` variant of `HitObjectKind` to denote the sample played on slider heads, ends, and repeats

# v0.5.2 (2022-06-14)

- __Fixes:__
  - Fixed parsing non-UTF-8 encoded files and improved parse performance overall ([#9])
  - Handle missing approach rate properly this time

## v0.5.1 (2022-03-21)

- __Fixes:__
  - Performance calculation for taiko & mania now considers custom clock rates properly

## v0.5.0 (2022-03-21)

- __Fixes:__
  - Fixed panic on maps with 0 objects
  - Fixed droplet timings on juicestreams with span count >1
  - Fixed timing point parsing on some (older) maps where "uninherited" value did not coincide with beat length
  - Fixed handling .osu files with missing difficulty attributes
  - Fixed huge memory allocations caused by incorrectly parsing .osu files
- __Breaking changes:__
  - The `stars` and `strains` functions for all modes were removed. Instead use the `{Mode}Stars` builder pattern which is similar to `{Mode}PP`.
  - `BeatmapExt::stars`'s definition was adjusted to use the `AnyStars` builder struct
  - Store `HitObject::sound` in `Beatmap::sounds` instead to reduce the struct size
  - Removed the mode features `osu`, `fruits`, `taiko`, and `mania`. Now all modes are always supported.
  - Renamed the `rosu_pp::fruits` module to `rosu_pp::catch`. Similarly, all structs `Fruits{Name}` were renamed to `Catch{Name}` and enums over the mode have their `Fruits` variant renamed to `Catch`
  - Renamed `Mods`' method `speed` to `clock_rate`
- __Additions:__
  - Added `AttributeProvider` impl for `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes`
  - Added the method `clock_rate` to `{Mode}PP` and `{Mode}Stars` to consider a custom clock rate instead of the one dictated by mods.

## v0.4.0 (2021-11-25)

- Fixed out of bounds panic on maps with single-control-point linear sliders
- Fixed incorrect attributes on maps with only 1 or 2 hit objects for all modes
- Added method `Beatmap::from_path` so the file does not have to be created manually for `Beatmap::parse`.
- Added a bunch of documentation.
- Added method `Beatmap::bpm`
- Added method `max_combo` for `DifficultyAttributes`, `PerformanceAttributes`, and all `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes`
- Added methods `TaikoDifficultyAttributes::max_combo` and `OsuDifficultyAttributes::max_combo`
- Added structs `{Mode}GradualDifficultyAttributes` to calculate a map's difficulty after every or every few objects instead of calling the mode's `stars` function over and over.
- Added structs `{Mode}GradualPerformanceAttributes` to calculate the performance on a map after every or every few objects instead of using `{Mode}PP` over and over.
- Added `BeatmapExt::gradual_difficulty` and `BeatmapExt::gradual_performance` to gradually calculate the difficulty or performance on maps of any mode, hit object by hit object.
- Added methods `{Mode}PP::state` that take a `{Mode}ScoreState` (same for `AnyPP` and `ScoreState`) to set all parameters at once.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `ParseError` variants `InvalidPathType` and `InvalidTimingSignature` and renamed `InvalidFloatingPoint` to `InvalidDecimalNumber`.
- [BREAKING] Removed the `last_control_point` field of `HitObjectKind::Slider` when neither the `osu` nor the `fruits` feature is enabled.
- [BREAKING] Added the field `TaikoDifficultyAttributes::max_combo`
- [BREAKING] Renamed the `attributes` field to `difficulty` for all `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes` structs
- [BREAKING] Replaced field `FruitsDifficultyAttributes::max_combo` by a method with the same name

## v0.3.0 (2021-11-14)

- [BREAKING] With the importance of sliders for osu!standard, the `no_sliders_no_leniency` feature became too inaccurate. Additionally, since considering sliders now inherently drags performance down a little more, the difference between `no_leniency` and `all_included` became too small. Hence, the three osu features `no_sliders_no_leniency`, `no_leniency`, and `all_included` were removed. When the `osu` feature is enabled, it will now essentially use `all_included` under the hood.
  Additionally, instead of importing through `rosu_pp::osu::{version}`, you now have to import through `rosu_pp::osu`.
- [BREAKING] Instead of returning `PpResult`, performance calculations now return `{Mode}PerformanceAttributes` and `PpResult` has been renamed to `PerformanceAttributes`.
- [BREAKING] Instead of returning `StarResult`, difficulty calculations now return `{Mode}DifficultyAttributes` and `StarResult` has been renamed to `DifficultyAttributes`.
- [BREAKING] Various fields and methods now include `f64` instead of `f32` to stay true to osu!'s original code
- Added internal binary crate `pp-gen` to calculate difficulty & pp values via `PerformanceCalculator.dll`
- Added internal binary crate `pp-plot` to plot out differences between `pp-gen`'s output and `rosu-pp` values
- osu: Updated up to commit [9fb2402781ad91c197d51aeec716b0000f52c4d1](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commit/9fb2402781ad91c197d51aeec716b0000f52c4d1) (2021-11-12)

  - Affected types: `DifficultyPoint`, `HitObject`, `Pos2`, `TimingPoint`, `HitObjectKind`, `PathType`, `HitSound`
