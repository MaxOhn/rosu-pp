//! Library to calculate difficulty and performance attributes for all [osu!] gamemodes.
//!
//! A large part of `rosu-pp` is a port of [osu!lazer]'s difficulty and performance calculation
//! with emphasis on a precise translation to Rust for the most [accurate results](#accuracy)
//! while also providing a significant [boost in performance](#speed).
//!
//! Last commits of the ported code:
//!   - [osu!lazer] : `8bd65d9938a10fc42e6409501b0282f0fa4a25ef` (2024-11-08)
//!   - [osu!tools] : `89b8f3b1c2e4e5674004eac4723120e7d3aef997` (2024-11-03)
//!
//! News posts of the latest updates: <https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2024-10-28-performance-points-star-rating-updates>
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! // Decode the map
//! let map = akatsuki_pp::Beatmap::from_path("./resources/2785319.osu").unwrap();
//!
//! // Calculate difficulty attributes
//! let diff_attrs = akatsuki_pp::Difficulty::new()
//!     .mods(8 + 16) // HDHR
//!     .calculate(&map);
//!
//! let stars = diff_attrs.stars();
//!
//! // Calculate performance attributes
//! let perf_attrs = akatsuki_pp::Performance::new(diff_attrs)
//!     // To speed up the calculation, we used the previous attributes.
//!     // **Note** that this should only be done if the map and all difficulty
//!     // settings stay the same, otherwise the final attributes will be incorrect!
//!     .mods(24) // HDHR, must be the same as before
//!     .combo(789)
//!     .accuracy(99.2)
//!     .misses(2)
//!     .calculate();
//!
//! let pp = perf_attrs.pp();
//!
//! // Again, we re-use the previous attributes for maximum efficiency.
//! let max_pp = perf_attrs.performance()
//!     .mods(24) // Still the same
//!     .calculate()
//!     .pp();
//!
//! println!("Stars: {stars} | PP: {pp}/{max_pp}");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Gradual calculation
//!
//! Gradually calculating attributes provides an efficient way to process each hitobject
//! separately and calculate the attributes only up to that point.
//!
//! For difficulty attributes, there is [`GradualDifficulty`] which implements `Iterator`
//! and for performance attributes there is [`GradualPerformance`] which requires the current
//! score state.
//!
//! ```
//! use akatsuki_pp::{Beatmap, GradualPerformance, Difficulty, any::ScoreState};
//!
//! let map = Beatmap::from_path("./resources/1028484.osu").unwrap();
//!
//! let mut gradual = Difficulty::new()
//!     .mods(16 + 64) // HRDT
//!     .clock_rate(1.2)
//!     .gradual_performance(&map);
//!
//! let mut state = ScoreState::new(); // empty state, everything is on 0.
//!
//! // The first 10 hitresults are 300s
//! for _ in 0..10 {
//!     state.n300 += 1;
//!     state.max_combo += 1;
//!     let attrs = gradual.next(state.clone()).unwrap();
//!     println!("PP: {}", attrs.pp());
//! }
//!
//! // Fast-forward to the end
//! # /*
//! state.max_combo = ...
//! state.n300 = ...
//! state.n_katu = ...
//! ...
//! # */
//! let attrs = gradual.last(state).unwrap();
//! println!("PP: {}", attrs.pp());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Accuracy
//!
//! `rosu-pp` was tested against all current beatmaps on multiple mod combinations and delivered
//! values that matched osu!lazer perfectly down to the last decimal place.
//!
//! However, there is one small caveat: the values are only this precise on debug mode.
//! On release mode, Rust's compiler performs optimizations that produce the tiniest discrepancies
//! due to floating point inaccuracies which can cascade into larger differences in the end.
//! With this in mind, `rosu-pp` is still as accurate as can be without targeting the
//! .NET compiler itself. Realistically, the inaccuracies in release mode are negligibly small.
//!
//! ## Speed
//!
//! An important factor for `rosu-pp` is the calculation speed. Optimizations and an accurate translation
//! unfortunately don't always go hand-in-hand. Nonetheless, performance improvements are still
//! snuck in wherever possible, providing a significantly faster runtime than the native C# code.
//!
//! Results of a rudimentary [benchmark] of osu!lazer and rosu-pp:
//! ```txt
//! osu!lazer:
//! Decoding maps:            Median: 378.10ms | Mean: 381.47ms
//! Calculating difficulties: Median: 588.89ms | Mean: 597.11ms
//! Calculating performances: Median: 315.90µs | Mean: 310.60µs
//!
//! rosu-pp:
//! Decoding maps:            Median: 46.94ms | Mean: 47.21ms
//! Calculating difficulties: Median: 72.90ms | Mean: 73.13ms
//! Calculating performances: Median: 44.13µs | Mean: 45.53µs
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! | Flag          | Description         | Dependencies
//! | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------
//! | `default`     | No features enabled |
//! | `raw_strains` | With this feature, internal strain values will be stored in a plain `Vec`. This introduces an out-of-memory risk on maliciously long maps (see [/b/3739922](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/3739922)), but comes with a ~5% gain in performance. |
//! | `sync`        | Some gradual calculation types can only be shared across threads if this feature is enabled. This feature adds a small performance penalty. |
//! | `tracing`     | Any error encountered during beatmap decoding will be logged through `tracing::error`. If this feature is **not** enabled, errors will be ignored. | [`tracing`]
